4. Varacity - The bias, noise and trust worthiness of data.
5. Velace - Connectivity of Big data between data 
6. Value- How big data is going to benefit you and your organization

**Volume :**
Higher volume comes with challenges related to cost, performace and accessing high volumes of data.
Another challenge is analytical models won't be scaleable to perform well on high volume systems.
 
**Variety :**
Data is generated in various formats Image, text, audio. Majorly this can be scalled or measured using four
dimensions *Structural Variety*, *Media Variety*, *Semantic Variety*, *Availability Variety*
Some times one datasource may contain different variety of data.  </br>
    **Email System** this generates informaiton some as sturctured and unstructured. And Email system is realtime however
Email Inbox is intemittent. 

**Velocity :**
Big data can influence quality of human life. Real-time processing of infromation required high velocity of data. </br>

**Real-time Processing:**
Speed of processing should inform speed of information generation. **Streaming Analysis**
Precision of minute makes more important and some time precision of an year is more importance.

# BigData_Learning
Big Data is latest and hugely demand in the market, all my works or scripts related to Bigdata are stored in this repository
 This has details of course information. </br>
 
 -> I am going through "Introduction of Big Data"
    This has 4 weeks of contents.</br>

     In week1: Tutor is explaining about casestudies explaining the essence of bigdata.
     One of the casestudies is "Providing Precision Medicines to patient". This includes providing customized therapy to individual patient.
     There is one ppt on slideshare explaining Markevalues of Bigdata systems.
     The Types of sources of Bigdata, Data generated by People, Sensors and Stystems.
     Machines, people and origanization.
     
  Big data is structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.
  Data Enable decisions
     
     Three main properties to call a device a smart
     * They can connect to other devices
     * Collect and analyze data anonymously
     * Provide environmental context
     Activity Trackers:
     * Distance run
   Machines generate lot of data and they are the generators of bigdata. </br>
        
        In-situ - Bring computation to data
        RDBMs- Take data to computational space and do the analysis.
        
   Culture shift to Real-time processing </br>
   
        Customer relationships
        Fraud Detection
        System monitoring/control
        
      Scalable computersystems
        AmazonWebservices
        Microsoft Azure
   Generating unstructured data by people through youtube, instagram, twitter. Most of this data is unstructured data.
   In one data Facebook users generate huge data compared to US Academic data. This unstructured data gives lot of changes. Unstructured data is data which doesn't have datamodel. 
   Humans generate lot of unstructured data.</Br>
 
   Unstructured data text,images,videos and audios. </br>
   
        Velocity is the amount of data generated in a particular amount of time is increasing rapidly by humans.
        Acquiring,storing, cleaning and processing of unstructured data is hellbent task. In the world 80 to 90% of data
        unstructured. </br>
        Advantages of Hadoop,storm,spark and Nosql.</br>
        Challenge is an opportunity.
        Hadoop is designed to support Bigdata. </br>
        Social media and Finance Market data or high velocity data. Unstructured data has no datamodel. </br>
        ETL doesn't work with Unstructured data.
        Neo4J is graph database. ( this is NOSql data)
        Keyvalue pair database Ex: Cassandra (this is NoSql Data)
        Crisismapers.net use </br>
           
  Scale and speed is most important. 
  Organization generated data </br>
  < color ='red'>
  * Commercial Transactions
  * Government Open Data
  * Sale Transaction Data </br>

  Highly structured data is generated by organizations. Spreadsheets are strucutred data. </br>
  Data model defines individual columns in the tables and whats the relationship between columns.</br>
  Many organizations have built their database individual to each department. </br>
  Cloud based solutions are agile and low capital based solutions in the area of organizational data analysis. Organizations must face attention in breaking up the silos of informaiton.</br>
  Organization generated data benefits come from adding othertypes of data. </br>
